To use input-sensitive profiling to identify situations where combinations of thread locks can significantly worsen the performance of the application FileZilla, FTP solution . Analyze performance points like self-cost, cumulative cost, number of calls, average cost, minimum cost, RMS(Read memory size) from each profiling session and correctly characterizing both thread-induced and external input.Identifying bottlenecks for different inputs.
